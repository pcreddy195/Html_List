    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building platform-independent applications. 
    Known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, Java applications can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
    It is commonly used for developing web applications, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more. Java emphasizes reliability, security, and maintainability.
