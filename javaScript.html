    JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. 
    It allows developers to implement features such as form validation, content updates without reloading the page, animations, and much more. 
    JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance user experience and is supported by all modern web browsers.
