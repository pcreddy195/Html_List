    MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). 
    Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require predefined schemas, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. 
    It is widely used in modern web applications for its scalability, high performance, and ease of use with programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Node.js.
