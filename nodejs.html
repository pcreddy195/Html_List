    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. 
    Built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 engine, Node.js is known for its speed and scalability. 
    It is widely used for building fast, real-time web applications, APIs, and microservices. 
    With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js is ideal for handling many simultaneous connections efficiently.
