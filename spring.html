    Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration. 
    It simplifies the process of building Java web applications by providing default settings, embedded servers like Tomcat, and built-in support for REST APIs, security, and database integration. 
    Spring Boot follows the “convention over configuration” principle, making it easy to start new projects quickly.
