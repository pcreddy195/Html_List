    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL (Structured Query Language). 
    It is widely used for storing, managing, and retrieving data in web applications. 
    Known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, MySQL is the database of choice for many developers using PHP, Java, or Python. 
    It supports large-scale systems and is commonly used in content management systems like WordPress, as well as enterprise and cloud applications.
