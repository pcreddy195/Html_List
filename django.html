    Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
    It provides built-in features like an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), authentication system, admin interface, URL routing, and more â€” reducing the need for boilerplate code. 
    Django follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and is widely used for building secure and scalable web applications quickly.
